# Data-driven Analysis for a Bike-share Company: An Insight into Cyclistic’s bike-share dataset to maximize marketing strategy

# Introduction
Launched in 2016, Cyclistic, a successful bike-share company runs a bike-share program in Chicago, USA. They also offer reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, to make bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. Currently, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, geotracked and locked into a network of 692 docking stations across Chicago, where the bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Majority of the riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options, about 30% of the riders use the bike to commute to work every day, while the rest more likely use it for leisure. With the flexibility in the pricing plans packages namely: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, the users are divided into two (2) major categories: the casual riders (customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and the cyclistic members (those who purchase annual memberships).
Reports of the business finance analysts revealed that, though the flexibility in the pricing packages attracts more customers, the company generates more profits from the cyclistic members (those who purchase annual memberships). The director of marketing also believes that the key to the business future growth is to maximize the cyclistic members’ population. Therefore, the need to identify how these two (2) users groups differ in the use of the services Cyclistic bike-share company offer as well as design marketing strategies to ensure conversion of casual riders into annual members for optimum business opportunities.
